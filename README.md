# Pewlett Hackard Analysis: The Impact of the Silver Tsunami on Retiring and Mentorship

## Overview

This analysis was conducted in order to inform hiring and promotion at Pewlett Hackard based on employee age/proximity to retirement.  Analyses were conducted to determine the number of retiring employees per title and determine the pool of employees most eligible for mentorship into newly vacant roles. 

## Results
 - Senior positions in general make up the majority of titles expected to retire soon.  Between Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, Pewlett Hackartd can expect to lose roughly 50,000 in the upcoming silver tsunami.  This makes sense as older employees are most likely to be in more senior roles.
 - Engineering (both senior and non-senior staff) will be the largest department within the company impacted by increased retiring rates.  The engineering department alone is expected to lose over 35,000.
 - Lower-level staff and engineers will result in roughly 10,000 personnel losses.  While the loss due to retiring is not nearly as substantial at lower levels, these results indicate that the silver tsunami will be felt company-wide; simply promoting from within will not be enough to keep up with the staggering impact of the silver tsunami at Pewlett Hackard.  
 - While mentorship will help cushion the blow dealt by increasing retirement, it's clear that the need for mentoriship will be high as well.  The mentorship eligibility analysis indicates that less than 1,000 currently employeed Engineers *might* be eligible for mentorship into more senior roles. There are less than 400 Senior Staff and Engineers 

## Summary
1. Retirement projections estimate that Pewlett Hackard will lost close to 1/3 of its staff in the upcoming silver tsunami.  While promoting from within may help fill some higher level positions, hiring of new staff and mentorship of existing staff must begin in earnest in order to keep up with projected personnel losses. See chart below for total projected number of roles to be filled (discussed in results above)
